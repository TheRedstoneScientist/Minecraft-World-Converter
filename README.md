The purpose of this fork of gentlegiant's WorldConverter MCEdit filter:

JGC has said he will no longer be updating this filter in favor of MCCToolChest.
I would like to continue using it and would like to try to keep it updated.

Currently there are a number of non-essential features missing.

Also item conversion was not completed.
